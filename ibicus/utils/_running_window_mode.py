        This return structure is chosen because usually only one array is adjusted (the future climate model run) but multiple sets of observations and climate model runs come in to calculate the adjusted values: historical observations and climate model run. So for each of those the indices in window given a window center are required and can be calculated given the window center.


        days_of_year and years are suppposed to be arrays of values corresponding to time ordered observations or climate model runs and giving for each the day of year and year respectively. So eg. for observations spanning the period 1980-2000 days_of_year will have values starting from 0 to 364 and repeating that for the number of years (adding 365 in case of a leap year). years will be similar.
        The array of years is required to repect year bounds inside of the values to adjust. For example if the window_center is 365 and the step size 5 then the day of year values to store the bc values would be [363, 364, 365, and 366, 1 or 1, 2]. However since this would extend into the following year -- values already covered by another running window center/index -- days 1 and 2 are filtered out using years.
