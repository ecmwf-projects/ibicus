    """
    |br| Implements CDF-t based on Michelangeli et al. 2009, Vrac et al. 2012 and Famien et al. 2018, as well as Vrac et al. 2016 for precipitation.

    CDFt is a non-parametric quantile mapping method that attempts to be trend-preserving in all quantiles. CDFt applies a concatenation between a quantile mapping of future and historical climate model data and a quantile mapping of the future climate model with historical observations. It also includes a running window over the future period to account for changes in the simulated trend.


    Let cm refer to climate model output, obs to observations and hist/future to whether the data was collected from the reference period or is part of future projections.
    In this methodology, all cdfs are estimated empirically. Let :math:`F` therefore be an empirical cdf.
    The future climate projections :math:`x_{\\text{cm_fut}}` are then mapped using a QQ-mapping between :math:`F_{\\text{cm_fut}}` and :math:`F_{\\text{obs_fut}}`, with:

    .. math:: F_{\\text{obs_fut}} := F_{\\text{obs_hist}}(F^{-1}_{\\text{cm_hist}}(F_{\\text{cm_fut}})).

    This means that :math:`x_{\\text{cm_fut}}` is mapped using the following formula:

    .. math:: x_{\\text{cm_fut}} \\rightarrow F^{-1}_{\\text{obs_fut}}(F_{\\text{cm_fut}}(x_{\\text{cm_fut}})) = F^{-1}_{\\text{cm_fut}}(F_{\\text{cm_hist}}(F^{-1}_{\\text{obs_hist}}(F_{\\text{cm_fut}}(x_{\\text{cm_fut}}))))

    Because an empirical CDF will not be able to map values outside its fitted range, a delta shift is applied to the future and historical climate model prior to fitting empirical CDFs. This ensures that the data is approximately in the same range. This delta shift can be additive:

    .. math:: x_{\\text{cm_fut}} \\rightarrow x_{\\text{cm_fut}} + \\bar x_{\\text{obs}} - \\bar x_{\\text{cm_hist}}
    .. math:: x_{\\text{cm_hist}} \\rightarrow x_{\\text{cm_hist}} + \\bar x_{\\text{obs}} - \\bar x_{\\text{cm_hist}}

    or multiplicative:

    .. math:: x_{\\text{cm_fut}} \\rightarrow x_{\\text{cm_fut}} \\cdot \\frac{\\bar x_{\\text{obs}}}{\\bar x_{\\text{cm_hist}}}
    .. math:: x_{\\text{cm_hist}} \\rightarrow x_{\\text{cm_hist}} \\cdot \\frac{\\bar x_{\\text{obs}}}{\\bar x_{\\text{cm_hist}}}

    Here :math:`\\bar x` stands for the mean over all x-values.

    After this shift by the absolute or relative mean bias between cm_hist and obs are applied to both cm_fut and cm_hist, the cm_fut values are mapped as shown above using the QQ-mapping between :math:`F_{\\text{cm_fut}}` and :math:`F_{\\text{obs_fut}}`.

    - If ``SSR = True`` then Stochastic Singularity Removal (SSR) based on Vrac et al. 2016 is used to correct the precipitation occurrence in addition to amounts (default setting for ``pr``). All zero values are first replaced by uniform draws between 0 and a small threshold (the minimum positive value of observation and model data). Then CDFt-mapping is used and afterwards all observations under the threshold are set to zero again.
    - If ``running_window_mode_over_years_of_cm_future = True`` (default) then the method is used in a running window mode, running over the values of the future climate model. This helps to smooth discontinuities. Default is a window length and step length of 31 days which corresponds broadly to application by month as in Famien et al. 2018.
    - If ``running_window_mode_within_year = True`` (default) then the method is used in a running window mode, running over the year to account for seasonalities.

    .. warning:: Currently only uneven sizes are allowed for window length and window step length. This allows symmetrical windows of the form [window_center - window length//2, window_center + window length//2] given an arbitrary window center.

    **Usage information:**

    - Default settings exist for: ``["hurs", "pr", "psl", "rlds", "rsds", "sfcWind", "tas", "tasmin", "tasmax", "tasrange", "tasskew"]``.

    - :py:func:`apply` requires: time arguments ``time_obs``, ``time_cm_hist``, and ``time_cm_future`` next to ``obs``, ``cm_hist`` and ``cm_future``. These are just 1d numpy-arrays of dates (multiple formats are possible as long as they as convertible to numpy or datetime dates) specifying the date for each value/timestep in ``obs``, ``cm_hist`` and ``cm_future``. If they are not specified they are inferred, assuming the first observation in all three observation/climate value arrays is on a 1st of January.

    - The debiaser has been developed for and assumes daily data, however application on data using other time specifications (monthly etc.) is possible by modifying the running window arguments and specifying the time arguments in :py:func:`apply`.

    |br|
    **Examples:**

    Running without dates (they are inferred assuming the first value in ``obs``, ``cm_hist`` and ``cm_future`` always corresponds to a January 1st):

    >>> debiaser = CDFt.from_variable("pr")
    >>> debiaser.apply(obs, cm_hist, cm_future)

    Running with dates:

    >>> debiaser = CDFt.from_variable("pr")
    >>> debiaser.apply(obs, cm_hist, cm_future, time_obs = time_obs, time_cm_hist = time_cm_hist, time_cm_future = time_cm_future)
