class SeasonalRunningWindowDebiaser(Debiaser):
    """
    A generic debiaser meant for subclassing which applies methods in a running window over the year to account for seasonality. Provides functionality for individual debiasers and a unified interface to apply bias adjustment.

    Have a look at the :py:class:`Debiaser` parent class for the general structure. In order to subclass the :py:class:`RunningWindowDebiaser`-class, the proposed debiaser needs to implement the :py:func:`from_variable` and :py:func:`apply_window` functions:

    - :py:func:`apply_on_window`: this applies an initialised debiaser at one location and in one window. Arguments are 1d-vectors of obs, cm_hist, and cm_future representing observations, and climate model values during the reference (cm_hist) and future period (cm_future) as well as time-information ``time_obs``, ``time_cm_hist`` and ``time_cm_future``) as 1d-numpy arrays corresponding to ``obs``, ``cm_hist`` ``and cm_future``. Additionally time a``kwargs`` passed to the debiaser :py:func:`apply`-function are passed down to the :py:func:`apply_location`-function.

    - :py:func:`from_variable`: initialises a debiaser with default arguments given a climatic variable either as ``str`` or member of the :py:class:`Variable`-class. ``kwargs`` are meant to overwrite default arguments for this variable. Given a `dict` of default arguments: with variables of the :py:class:`Variable` class as keys and `dict` of default arguments as values the :py:func:`_from_variable`-function can be used.

    The :py:func:`apply` function, maps the debiaser's :py:func:`apply_window` function over windows and locations. This allows to always initialise and apply debiasers follows:

    >>> debiaser = LinearScaling.from_variable("tas", running_window_mode = True) # LinearScaling is a child-class of Debiaser
    >>> debiased_cm_future = debiaser.apply(obs, cm_hist, cm_future, time_obs = time_obs, time_cm_hist = time_cm_hist, time_cm_future = time_cm_future)

    Attributes

    reasonable_physical_range : Optional[list]

    running_window_mode : bool

        Length of the running window in days: how many values are used to calculate the bias adjustment transformation. Only relevant if ``running_window_mode = True``. Default: ``31``.

        Step length of the running window in days: how many values are bias adjusted inside the running window and by how far it is moved. Only relevant if ``running_window_mode = True``. Default: ``1``.
