class DeltaChange(Debiaser):
    """
    |br| Implements 'delta change' method based on Maraun 2016 as reference.

    This is technically not a bias correction method because the future climate model output is not transformed. Instead, the delta change method applies the climate change trend from the model to historical observations, therefore generating modified observations rather than a modified model output.
    So the output by :py:func:`apply` from this method has the same number of timesteps as the obs data, and not the same number as cm_fut like other debiasers.

    Let :math:`x_{\\text{obs}}` be the observed timeseries :math:`x_{\\text{cm_hist}}` the simulated historical one and :math:`x_{\\text{cm_fut}}` the simulated future one (climate model historical and future run).
    For an additive change a future timeseries is generated as:

    .. math::  x_{\\text{obs}} +  (\\bar x_{\\text{cm_fut}} - \\bar x_{\\text{cm_hist}})

    and for multiplicative change:

    .. math:: x_{\\text{obs}} \\cdot \\frac{\\bar x_{\\text{cm_fut}}}{\\bar x_{\\text{cm_hist}}}.

    Here :math:`\\bar x` stands for the mean over all x-values.

    Multiplicative change is typically used for precipitation and additive scaling for temperature.

    **Usage information:**

    - Default settings exist for: ``["hurs", "pr", "psl", "rlds", "rsds", "sfcWind", "tas", "tasmin", "tasmax"]``.

    - :py:func:`apply` requires: no additional arguments except ``obs``, ``cm_hist``, ``cm_future``.

    - The debiaser works with data in any time specification (daily, monthly, etc.).

    |br|
    **Examples:**

    >>> debiaser = DeltaChange.from_variable("tas")
    >>> debiaser.apply(obs, cm_hist, cm_future)

    Attributes
    ----------
    delta_type : str
        One of ``["additive", "multiplicative"]``. Determines whether additive or multiplicative scaling is used.

    running_window_mode : bool
        Whether DeltaChange is used in running window over the year to account for seasonality. If ``running_window_mode = False`` then DeltaChange is applied on the whole period. Default: ``False``.
    running_window_length : int
        Length of the running window in days: how many values are used to calculate the bias adjustment transformation. Only relevant if ``running_window_mode = True``. Default: ``31``.
    running_window_step_length : int
        Step length of the running window in days: how many values are bias adjusted inside the running window and by how far it is moved. Only relevant if ``running_window_mode = True``. Default: ``1``.

    variable : str
        Variable for which the debiasing is used
